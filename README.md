interesting Julia set locations:
from Karl Sims
```c = -0.79 + 0.15i
c = -0.162 + 1.04i
c = 0.3 - 0.01i
c = -1.476 + 0i
c = -0.12 - 0.77i
c = 0.28 + 0.008i
```
from Wikipedia
```c = 0 - 0.8i
c = -0.7269 + 0.1889i
c = -0.835 - 0.2321i
c = -0.8 + 0.156i
c = 0.45 + 0.1428i
c = 0.285 + 0.01i
c = (phi-2)+(phi-1)i = -0.4 + 0.6i
c = 1-phi
c = -0.726895347709114071439 + 0.188887129043845954792i
```
from Wikipedia, discussing correspondence between Mandelbrot and Julia sets
Mandelbrot set centered about `(-0.743643887037151 + 0.131825904205330i)` with a horizontal diameter of `0.000000000051299`. The corresponding Julia set centered about `(0 + 0i)` and with a horizontal diameter of `0.009860138819832269`.
